# Token

## Token Overview

## Token State Transition Details

All token transitions include the [token base transition fields](#token-base-transition). Most token transitions (.e.g., [token mint](#token-mint-transition)) require additional fields to provide their functionality.

### Token Base Transition

The following fields are included in all token transitions:

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| $identityContractNonce | unsigned integer | 64 bits | Identity contract nonce |
| $tokenContractPosition | unsigned integer | 16 bits | Position of the token within the contract |
| $dataContractId | array | 32 bytes | Data contract ID [generated](../protocol-ref/data-contract.md#data-contract-id) from the data contract's `ownerId` and `entropy` |
| $tokenId | array | 32 bytes | Token ID generated from the data contract ID and the token position |
| usingGroupInfo | [GroupStateTransitionInfo object](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/group/mod.rs#L42-L59) | Varies | Optional field indicating group multi-party authentication rules |

Each token transition must comply with the [token base transition defined in rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/state_transition/state_transitions/document/batch_transition/batched_transition/token_base_transition/v0/mod.rs#L45-L72).

#### Token Transition Action

The token transition actions [defined in rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/state_transition/state_transitions/document/batch_transition/batched_transition/token_transition_action_type.rs#L7-L17) indicate what operation platform should perform with the provided transition data.

| 1 | [Mint](#token-mint-transition) | Create new tokens |
| 2 | [Transfer](#token-transfer-transition) | Send tokens from one identity to another |
| 3 | [Freeze](#token-freeze-transition) | Restrict an identityâ€™s ability to transfer or use tokens |
| 4 | [Unfreeze](#token-unfreeze-transition) | Lift a freeze restriction on an identity's tokens |
| 5 | [Destroy Frozen Funds](#token-destroy-frozen-funds-transition) | Remove frozen tokens from an identity's balance |
| 6 | [Claim](#token-claim-transition) | Retrieve tokens based on a specified distribution method |
