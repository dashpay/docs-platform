# Identities

## What is an identity

An Identity is a blockchain-based identifier for individuals (users) and applications.  
Identities are the atomic element that, when linked with additional applications, can be extended to provide new functionality.

Read more on the Dash Platform documentation about [Identity](../../../explanations/identity.md).  
You might also want to consult the usage for the [DPNS Name Service](../names/names.md) in order to attach a name to your created identity.

## Credits

Each identity contains a credit balance. The ratio is 1 duff = 1000 credits.
